(defn- seq-tree
  "Takes a seq of events that logically represents
  a tree by each event being one of: enter-sub-tree event,
  exit-sub-tree event, or node event.

  Returns a lazy sequence whose first element is a sequence of
  sub-trees and whose remaining elements are events that are not
  siblings or descendants of the initial event.

  The given exit? function must return true for any exit-sub-tree
  event.  parent must be a function of two arguments: the first is an
  event, the second a sequence of nodes or subtrees that are children
  of the event.  parent must return nil or false if the event is not
  an enter-sub-tree event.  Any other return value will become
  a sub-tree of the output tree and should normally contain in some
  way the children passed as the second arg.  The node function is
  called with a single event arg on every event that is neither parent
  nor exit, and its return value will become a node of the output tree.
